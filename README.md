# Dedup 

This is a damn simple utility to remove files that are already present in another location.

Support you have folder `~/Photos` and another folder `~/Duplicates`.

First, you can compute checksums of all files in the first folder, like so:

```shell
$ dedup checksum ~/Photos photos.parquet
Enumerated files: 35680
Checksummed files: 35680
Writing to parquet: 35680
```

The checksums are stored in `photos.parquet`.

Second, you can see how many files from the second folder are present in the first one.

```shell
$ dedup delete ~/Duplicated photos.parquet
Read manifest: 35680 files
Enumerated files: 35568
Checksummed files: 35568
Files found in manifest at the same path: 35566
Files not found in manifest: 2
```

Finally, you can remove files in the second folder that are present in the first one.

```shell
$ dedup delete -really ~/Duplicated photos.parquet
```
